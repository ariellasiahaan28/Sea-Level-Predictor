# Sea-Level-Predictor

The Sea Level Predictor project involves using a dataset to model and predict sea-level rise over time. The task requires creating a linear regression model to forecast future sea levels based on historical data, using Python and libraries like Matplotlib and pandas for data manipulation and visualization. This project provides hands-on experience in working with time-series data and regression analysis.
